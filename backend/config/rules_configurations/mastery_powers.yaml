Hunt Target:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    During your activation, select a single enemy
    soldier and place a special effects token next to
    them. For the rest of the game turn, any rolls of
    1 against this target count as critical hits.
Lay Trap:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows your active soldier to perform an Interaction
    (difficulty 1) to lay a trap within their
    proximity (3"), using a special effects token.
    Any enemy that Moves within melee range (1") of the trap
    is immediately immobilized, loses any remaining action
    points (AP) and must perform an Interaction (difficulty 2)
    to disarm the trap and regain the ability to Move. The trap
    is removed when triggered. Only 3 traps may be active at
    once. Cannot be performed while engaged.
Throw Grenade:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows your active soldier to throw a grenade
    using a Firing action, instead of using a normal
    ranged weapon. A grenade is a ordnance weapon
    with short range (9"), damage 1 and a duration of 1.
Throw Bundled Grenade:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    Works exactly like a regular GRENADE,
    except that range is reduced to 3+D3",
    or 3+D6" when Focus Firing (2 AP), the damage
    is increased to 2 and the attack becomes piercing. Range is
    determined before deciding on a target.
Desperate Last Stand:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    When a friendly soldier is reduced to 0 vitality
    and about to be taken out, this ability allows
    them to perform a final 1 AP action as a reaction,
    but any rolls become desperate. If this final action
    triggers a free action of some kind, they may perform that
    too. If they manage to take out their would-be killer (the enemy
    soldier who took them out), they are not taken out and
    are restored back to 1 vitality. Otherwise, they are simply
    taken out unless CHEATING DEATH succeeds.
Cheating Death:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    When a friendly soldier is taken out and about to
    be removed, roll a fluke roll. On a roll of 6, the
    soldier survives with 1 vitality remaining. This
    roll is performed after any DESPERATE LAST STAND
    attempt has been made.
Gruesome Demise:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    When an enemy is taken out at short range (9")
    or closer, this ability may be used to ensure that
    the enemy is dispatched with intimidating cruelty.
    Any enemy within D6 of the target becomes shaken.
    Also, raise the terror level by 1, or by 2 if the
    target had a starting vitality of 4 or more.
Unnerving Presence:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    Whenever an enemy soldier is activated within
    short range (9") of a terror troop soldier, they
    must roll a D6 and unless the roll is higher
    than the terror level they are gripped by fear and count as
    shaken during their activation. The terror level is initially 1,
    but is increased by each GRUESOME DEMISE.
    Use a D6 to keep track of the current level. If it becomes 6
    or higher, the enemy roll becomes a fluke roll.
Throw Tox Grenade:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows your active soldier to throw a tox nade
    using a Firing action (instead of Firing normally).
    It is thrown to a location within short range
    (9"), which doesn't have to be in line-of-sight (measure the
    range as you would leap movement). It has no immediate
    effect, instead creating TOXICITY around its token.
    Only 3 tox grenades may be active at once. If an
    additional one is thrown, a prior one must be removed.
Toxicity:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    When enemy soldiers are activated within proximity
    (3") of your tox troops or a TOX GRENADE,
    but before they perform any actions, they must
    roll a D6. Unless they roll higher than the vitality of the
    nearest tox trooper, they take 1 damage. TOX GRENADES,
    "count as" having a vitality of 3.
Recover:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    This ability allows your active soldier to heal
    themselves using a free Interaction (difficulty
    1). A success restores 1 point of vitality, while a
    critical success restores 2 points. The ability costs 2 SP if
    the healing soldier is hardened.
Cling To Life:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    After a friendly soldier is taken out (and after
    any special rules/squad abilities have been
    used to try and prevent this), this ability may be
    used to have them cling to life. Instead of removing the soldier
    from the combat zone as normal, gently tip the model
    over. The soldier may not perform any actions, except for
    the RECOVER Interaction. While clinging to
    life, taking any damage results in being taken out. If healed
    back to at least 1 vitality, the soldier is returned to normal.
Request Artillery:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    Allows your active soldier to use a Fire action to
    request an artillery strike, which functions like
    an ordnance weapon with medium range (18"),
    damage 2 and duration 2. However, the blast radius is
    determined using 3D3" instead.
Quadrant Eradicatus:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 5
  rules: >
    Allows your active soldier to use an Interaction
    (difficulty 1) to contact high command and request
    that a combat sector be eradicated. Select
    a table quadrant (one corner of the combat zone, 1/4th of
    its total size). Set a duration of 2. After the duration, any
    and all soldiers and removeable terrain pieces fully within
    that quadrant are taken out/removed. Can only be used
    once per game.
Dig In!:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1

    This ability allows a soldier to perform an
    Interaction (difficulty 1), which grants them the
    benefit of cover without needing to be behind
    cover in the usual way. Place a special effects token next to
    the soldier. The ability lasts until the soldier Moves in any
    way. Cannot be performed while engaged.
Fix Bayonets!:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    When this ability is used, all soldiers without a
    melee weapon gain a normal 1 damage strike
    (in addition to their desperate strike). However,
    as they ready for hand-to-hand combat, their marksmanship
    is deemphasized and they no longer score crits when
    Firing. These effects last for the rest of the game turn.
Stim-Boost:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows the active soldier to gain 1 additional
    action point (AP) during their activation, but if it

    Also, a desperate D6 must be rolled. Unless an even roll is
    scored, the soldier also loses 1 point of vitality.
Surge:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    Allows an expended soldier to be activated
    again, but any Fight or Fire rolls are desperate
    and they lose 1 point of vitality. If this reduces
    them to 0 vitality, they may first perform their actions and
    then, if they roll an even number on a desperate D6, they
    survive with 1 vitality, otherwise they are taken out.
Shrug It Off:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    This ability is used when a soldier is activated
    and allows them to recover from the shaken effect,
    regaining their full action points (AP). This
    ability costs 1 SP if the soldier recovers 1 AP by not being
    shaken, and 2 SP for recovering 2 AP (like elites).
Cool Under Pressure:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true

  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    This ability improves the first shot roll of a Firing
    action by either 1 or 2, up to a maximum of
    6, depending on how many SPs are spent (e.g.
    a roll of 3 becomes either a 4 or 5). Decide before you roll.
    If the ranged weapon used has multiple shots, roll the first
    one separately (the remaining shots are not improved due
    to recoil). Cannot be used on desperate or fluke rolls.
Eagle-Eyed:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    Marksmen can stretch the effective range of

    not apply to flame weapons.
Quick Draw:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    At short range (9") or closer, after a soldier has
    completed a Firing action, this ability allows
    the soldier to Fire (1 AP) again, at no AP cost,
    picking a different target if desired, but any rolls become
    desperate. This ability costs 1 SP when used with pistol
    type weapons and 2 SP with any other type of ranged
    weapon. Additionally, this ability may be repeated, after the
    same original Firing action, as many times as your reserve
    of squad points (SP) allow if a pistol is used (otherwise it
    may only be used once each time).

  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    If a soldier is within proximity (3") of a friendly
    soldier targeted by an enemy Firing action, they
    may use this ability to perform a Firing (1 AP)
    action as a reaction against that enemy, provided that the
    enemy is within range and line-of-sight. Cannot be used
    if the soldier wishing to return fire was also damaged or
    shaken by the enemy attack.
Throw Smoke Grenade:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows the active soldier to throw a smoke
    grenade using an Interaction (difficulty 0). Place
    a special effects token within short range (9") of
    the soldier. Any Firing actions where line-of-sight passes
    over the token or within proximity (3") of it must use fluke
    rolls. The smoke has a duration of 2.
Piercing Ammo:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    Used during a Firing action to temporarily give
    a ranged weapon the piercing special rule. If

    hyper-piercing and may be used to ignore ironclad armour.
    The ability costs 2 SP if the weapon has multiple shots.
Incendiary Ammo:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    Transforms a ranged weapon into a flame weapon
    with short range (9") and damage 1 during
    a Firing action. If the weapon used is a flame
    weapon already, it becomes hyper-incendiary and increases
    its range by 3" and its hit roll by 3 (up to a maximum of
    6). The ability costs 2 SP if the weapon has multiple shots.
Return Fire:

    shaken by the enemy attack.
Targeting Marker:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Instead of Firing regularly, a soldier may shoot
    a targeting marker (using the same maximum
    range as an equipped range weapon). A targeting
    marker automatically hits its target but causes no damage.
    Instead, the targeted enemy doesn't gain the benefit of
    cover, defense or the items chameleon weave and cloaking
    field for the rest of the game turn.
Unload!:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    During a Focus Firing (2 AP) action, this ability
    can be used to temporarily double a ranged
    weapon's number of shots, instead of allowing
    rerolls, and make the weapon suppressive. If the weapon
    already is suppressive, this ability extends the range of the
    suppression effect of the weapon by D3".
Quantity Over Quality:
  is_epic: false

  rules: >
    After defeating an enemy in melee range (1"),
    a soldier may use this ability to keep the momentum
    up and freely Fight (1 AP) a different
    enemy or, if there are no eligible targets to Fight, they may
    instead freely Move (1 AP) to charge a different enemy,
    including freely Fighting (1 AP) that enemy as part of the
    charge. These options are possible even if the soldier has
    already Fought and/or Moved. Cannot be used if there are
    no eligible targets to either Fight or charge.
Frenzy:

  rules: >
    Bloodseekers caught in bloodshed find it easy
    to keep going! Whenever a successful strike is

    strike! Yeah, holy crap.
Reckless Charge:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    After the movement distance of a Move is
    determined, this ability can be used to add 3" of
    distance, provided that the soldier can, and will,
    use the Move to charge an enemy. If used, all strikes in the
    subsequent Fight action become desperate (strikes that are
    already desperate or flukes simply remain so).
Relentless Strikes:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2/3
  rules: >
    When about to Fight, this ability allows a soldier
    to gain either 1, 2 or 3 strikes with one equipped
    melee weapon, depending on how many SPs are
    spent, but each added strike is desperate (or flukes if the
    weapon already uses desperate or fluke rolls). If the soldier
    has no melee weapon, they may use this ability to gain
    fluke strikes in addition to their normal desperate strike.
Wind Strikes:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    After completing a Move, a soldier may use this
    ability to use the Fight action to allocate strikes
    against any enemy they passed within proximity

    attack enemies on the go. May not use cataclysmic
    weapons with this ability.
Dodge:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    When targeted by an enemy Fire or Fight action
    or reaction, a skillful dodge allows a soldier to
    reaction Move up to 3" before any rolls are performed.
    The enemy action is then performed with this new
    position in mind, which may mean that the dodging soldier
    is behind cover, out of range, further from a blast or out of
    line-of-sight which may make the action more difficult or
    fail outright.
Meet The Enemy:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1/2
  rules: >
    When an enemy is about to Fight, but before any
    rolls are made, guardians may use this ability to
    gain +1 or +2 defense depending on the amount
    of SPs spent. However, if the charged soldier already has
    +2 defense (max amount), they get to reaction Fight (1 AP)
    or Furiously Fight (2 AP) before the enemy (depending on
    amount of SPs used), but all strikes become desperate.
Triumphant Defense:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    Whenever they defeat an enemy in melee range

    defense, they may perform a free 1 AP action.
Scale Obstacle:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows a soldier with the normal movement type
    to temporarily gain the leap movement type
    during a Move action. If a soldier already has
    leap, this allows them to treat any dash roll as 6. However,
    if a soldier is grounded, this ability only changes their
    movement type to normal instead of leap.
Rig Explosives:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    Allows a soldier to plant explosives within their
    proximity (3"), using an Interaction (difficulty 1)
    and a special effects token. The explosives have
    a duration of 2, after which they "hit" and function like a
    blast weapon with damage 1, except that the blast radius is
    2D6". If the explosives are placed on, or are within melee
    range (1") of, a removable terrain piece or an objective,
    they are destroyed and removed from play. Any soldiers
    standing on the terrain piece are taken out. Enemies can
    attempt to disarm the explosives using an Interaction
    (difficulty 4). Usable once per game.
Flank 'Em!:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    When one of your soldiers is about to Move, this
    ability allows them to end that Move beyond the
    edge of the combat zone, thereby leaving it. In
    the next game turn, upon their activation, they can be redeployed
    anywhere along the same combat zone edge (within
    melee range (1") of the edge, but outside melee range (1")
    of enemes). This redeployment does not count as an action
    and the soldier may spend all of their action points (AP) as
    normal.
Steady Marchers:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    Rangers might not always be the quickest, but
    they are consistent and reliable on the march.
    Any time a dash roll is about to be performed,
    a ranger may choose to treat any die roll as 4 instead of
    rolling it (for example, 2D6" can be treated as 8"). When a
    D3 is used, this ability may be used to count it as 2.
Drop Soldier:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    A skyborne squad may opt to not deploy any
    amount of soldiers during the initial deployment,
    instead using this ability to deploy the soldiers
    later. At the start of each game turn, any undeployed
    soldiers may use this ability to be dropped anywhere in the
    combat zone that is not within proximity (3") of an enemy.
    Dropped soldiers always count as expended initially. This
    ability may be used when reinforcing troopers in game turn
    4 or later. SP cost is per soldier.
Request Strafing Run:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 3
  rules: >
    Allows the active soldier to use an Interaction
    (difficulty 0) to request a strafing run. Place a
    special effects token anywhere in the combat
    zone and a second one within 3D6" of the first one. The
    request has a duration of 2. When the duration ends, any
    soldier within proximity (3") of the tokens or the line between
    them becomes shaken and a fluke roll is performed
    for each one - if successful, that particular soldier suffers 1
    damage. Usable once per game.
Breach!:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows a soldier to temporarily gain the breach
    movement type when they are about to make
    a Move. Any enemy within D6" of the breach
    "exit" suffers 1 point of damage. If the soldier already has
    the breach movement type, this becomes within 6" instead.
Throw Stun Grenade:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Allows a soldier to throw a stun grenade using
    a free Interaction (AP 1, difficulty 1). The stun
    grenade functions like a ordnance weapon with
    short range (9"), damage 0 and duration 1. Any target hit
    by the stun grenade is merely shaken.
Hit And Run:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    After a guerrilla soldier Fires or Fights, they
    may use this ability to Move D6" as a free action
    (even if they have Moved). Any reaction that
    their attack or this free Move triggers is delayed until after
    the Move is complete, which can make it more difficult or
    fail (due to lack of line-of-sight or so). When a minion uses
    this ability, it simply adds D6" to their scamper Move.
Setup Ambush Zone:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    Place a special effects token anywhere in the
    combat zone to represent your ambush zone.
    Any enemy that ends a Move within short range
    (9") of the token may be reaction Fired (1 AP) upon or reaction
    charged by 1 friendly soldier within short range (9")
    of the token (your choice of soldier). If the charge option is
    selected, your soldier may both Move into melee range (1")
    with the enemy and Fight (1 AP) freely. Only one ambush
    zone may be active at once.
In To / Out of The Shadows:

  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Upon finishing a Move, an infiltrator may fade
    into the shadows and remove themselves from
    the combat zone. The infiltrator must be out of
    short range (9") or line-of-sight of any enemy when this
    ability is used (either is enough). In a later game turn (not
    necessarily the next), when this ability is used again and
    the same infiltrator is activated, they may return to the
    combat zone in any location which fulfils the same restrictions
    as above. Reappearing counts as a Move (1 AP).
Low Profile:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true

    have them swap positions with a friendly soldier
    within medium range (18"). If both soldiers are of the same
    basic type (Minion/Trooper/Elite/Heavy) or a Phantom

    phantoms). A phantom can be activated like a soldier, but
    may only Move 6" each activation (normal movement type).
    If an enemy comes within proximity (3") of a phantom, it
    is destroyed. Use empty bases or special effects tokens to
    represent phantoms.
Critical Sabotage:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 2
  rules: >
    When an enemy activates a soldier, but before

    many credits as the agreed upon limit. However,
    heroes can be activated twice. After all heroes
    have been activated once, you may start activating them
    again in any order (place a second expended token next to
    a hero that has been activated twice). If a hero becomes
    shaken, that state only applies to their next activation
    during the current game turn.

  rules: >
    In a cannon fodder squad, troopers reinforce
    the squad every game turn (not just in turn 4).
    If a reinforcement site is blocked by an enemy
    presence, they may still arrive - but count as shaken.
Poor Combat Discipline:

  rules: >
    All troopers in a cannon fodder squad must use
    desperate rolls when Firing or Fighting, unless
    the rolls are desperate already, in which case
    they become flukes (flukes simply remain so). Lastly, cannon
    fodder troopers become shaken from all misses.
Conjure Psychic Power:
  is_epic: true
  is_passive: false
  sp_cost: 1
  rules: >
    Any soldier in your squad may use this ability to
    use a psychic power, using the same rules as if
    they were a normally trained psymancer (and
    not a master psymancer).
Arcane Knowledge:
  is_epic: false
  is_passive: true
  sp_cost: 0
  rules: >
    You may only select three psychic powers that
    can be used with CONJURE PSYCHIC POWER.
    These must be presented to your opponent as
    part of your squad masteries. However, your squad may
    also train a psymancer "as normal" (if you so desire), and
    that psymancer may choose psychic powers that differ
    from your squad's overall choices.
